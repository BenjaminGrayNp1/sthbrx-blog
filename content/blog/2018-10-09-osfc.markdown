I recently had the pleasure of attending the [2018 Open Source Firmware Conference](https://osfc.io) in Erlangen, Germany. Compared to other more general conferences I've attended in the past, the laser focus of OSFC on firmware and especially firmware security was fascinating. Seeing developers from across the world coming together to discuss how they are improving their corner of the stack was great, and I've walked away with plenty of new knowledge and ideas (and several kilos of German food and drink..).

What was especially exciting though is that I had the chance to talk about my work on [Petitboot](https://github.com/open-power/petitboot) and what's happened from the POWER8 launch until now. If you're interested in that, or seeing how I talk after 36 hours of travel, check it out here:
