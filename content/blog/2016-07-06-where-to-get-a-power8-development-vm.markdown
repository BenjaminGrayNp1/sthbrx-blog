*POWER8 sounds great, but where the heck can I get a Power VM so I can test my code?*

This is a common question we get at OzLabs from other open source developers looking to port their software to the Power Architecture. Unfortunately, most developers don't have one of our amazing servers just sitting around under their desk.

Thankfully, there's a few IBM partners who offer free VMs for development use. If you're in need of a development VM, check out:

 * [MiniCloud](http://openpower.ic.unicamp.br/minicloud/), hosted by the State University of Campinas (Unicamp), Brazil
 * [OSU Open Source Lab](http://osuosl.org/services/powerdev), hosted by the Oregon State University
 * [SuperVessel Cloud for Power/OpenPOWER](https://ptopenlab.com/cloudlabconsole), hosted by IBM China

So, next time you wonder how you can test your project on POWER8, request a VM and get to it!
